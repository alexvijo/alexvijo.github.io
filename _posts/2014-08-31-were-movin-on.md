Your tread must be light and sure, as though your path were upon rice paper. It is said, a Shaolin priest can walk through walls. Looked for, he can not be seen. Listened for, he can not be heard. Touched, can not be felt. This rice paper is the test. Fragile as the wings of the dragonfly, clinging as the cocoon of the silk worm. When you can walk its length and leave no trace. You will have learned.

Well we're movin' on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Movin' on up, To the east side. We finally got a piece of the pie. Fish don't fry in the kitchen, beans don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta tryin' just to get up that hill. Now we're up in the big leagues, gettin' our turn at bat. As long as we live, it's you and me baby, There ain't nothin' wrong with that. Well we're movin' on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. Movin' on up, to the east side. We finally got a piece of the pie.

Hey Tony! I like the things you do! Hey Tony! If I could I would be you! You're my one and only tiger, with my one and only taste! You know how to take a breakfast and make it mmm great! Frosted Flakes! They're more than good, they're great!
